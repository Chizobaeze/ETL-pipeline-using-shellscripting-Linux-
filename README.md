# Crypto Currency ETL Pipeline Using Bash
This is a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project I built using Bash scripting on a Linux environment. The goal was to practice automating data tasks without using Python or any fancy tools ‚Äî just shell commands and logic.

The script pulls crypto data from the CoinStats API, processes it, and loads it into a MySQL database. I built this as part of my learning journey into data engineering and working with Linux tools.

# üõ†Ô∏è What the Script Does
1. Extract: Gets cryptocurrency names and their values using the CoinStats API.
Saves the names in a file called name_currency.txt.
Saves the values in a separate file called values_currency.txt.

2. Transform: Adds headers to both files (Name and Value).
Merges the two into one CSV file: crypto_currency.csv.

3. Load: Connects to MySQL.
Creates a database and a table if they don‚Äôt exist.
Loads the CSV data into the crypto table using LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE.

# üß∞ Tools I Used
Curl (for making API requests).

Grep, sed, paste (for text processing).

MySQL.

Bash & .env file for environment variables.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up
.env File
I used a .env file to store my credentials and file paths. Here's what it looks like:

MYSQL_USER=root.

MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password.

DATABASE=crypto_data.

CSV_PATH=/full/path/to/crypto_currency.csv.
